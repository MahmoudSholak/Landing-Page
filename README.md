### javaScript
1. First : Declare Global Variable.

3. Third : Build Dynaminc Scroll & Add Active Class To The Links & Sections.
   - By knowing when we at scroll and when the section start and end.
   - Add a function to make smooth scroll when click at the links in navbar.
4. Fourth : Responsive Nav Bar icon.
   - control when the vertical navbar appear and disapper by click on the icon.
5. Fifth : Top Scroll Button.
   - Make the top scroll btn apper when window.scrollY > 700 and appear with small animation from the left.
   - Make the scroll when click smooth.
6. Finally : when i test the website i notice that when the screen at **mobile viewport** and the **icon is open** when i click in the window or scroll the vertical nav & icon doesn't close so i added another function to fix that and now when the icon is open and you click or scroll in window the icon and vertical nav close.
